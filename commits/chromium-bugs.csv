It is no longer required for our gnome keyring integration to work correctly. This has the side effect of avoiding an unlock prompt unless a login form would actually be filled in by data in the keyring, lessening phishing vulnerability. In order to make this work correctly, we also have to be a little more careful about when we commit to using the keyring instead of the built-in store. In particular, because it can succeed without unlocking when there is no data to return (which is good, and avoids unexpected unlock prompts), we must require that we actually got some data before assuming that we can use the keyring. Note that we don''t need to do any sort of merging or fall back to the built-in store in these cases, because we know it''s empty - if it had any data in it, we would have migrated it, and we wouldn''t be in this undecided state to begin with. This subtlety is probably the cause of some old repeated-unlock-prompt bugs that were masked by the unlock forcing.

This fixes a security vulnerability that occurs when the NaCl revision is updated to r4598 or later.  That revision changes NaCl''s sel_main_chrome.c so that it no longer registers a signal handler, but instead leaves Breakpad''s signal handler (registered by Chrome) in place. The vulnerability would allow NaCl untrusted code to escape NaCl''s inner sandbox on x86-32 Linux. This is because although NaCl''s signal handler knows how to safely handle faults from NaCl x86-32 sandboxed code, Breakpad''s signal handler does not.

This is to avoid bugs like http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=118064 in the future. Positional parameters are supported by the VC++ runtime via the set of "_p" flavored printf-like routines. MSDN claims that "By default the positional functions behave identically to the non position ones, if no positional formatting is present." There is a little difference that require some attention though. Currently base::vsnprintf and base::vswprintf wrappers use "_s" functions (so called "security enhanced versions"). Judging by looking at the CRT code, _p functions implement the same checks as _s ones do. The base wrappers call the CRT routines so that count == (sizeOfBuffer - 1). This reduces most of the additional code in _vsnprintf_s (comparing to _vsprintf_p) to no-op. Namely: 1. When truncation happens the tail of the buffer is filled with a pattern: _SECURECRT__FILL_STRING(string, sizeInBytes, count + 1); This does not happen in our case because sizeInBytes == count + 1. 2. The special case check shown below was never true since sizeInBytes != count in our case: if (count == 0 && string == NULL && sizeInBytes == 0) 3.

This will, of course, never happen. But in case it does, implement support for it. This requires us knowing whether the device is expecting a PIN Code or Passkey, and in the latter case converting the String we receive from JavaScript into a numeric to return.

There''s no case in the current codebase when we want to remove _only_ LSO data, and no case where we want to remove cookies, but _not_ LSO data. There are many instances of building removal masks that binary-OR REMOVE_LSO_DATA and REMOVE_COOKIES together; this CL formalizes that by dropping the extra enum value. Moreover, we talk about "cookies" differently when targeting users on the one hand, and developers on the other. REMOVE_COOKIES is a developer-facing name with a user-facing value, which is confusing. Renaming the current functionality to REMOVE_SITE_DATA is much more explicit, and will enable us to _just_ remove cookies at some point in the future via a REMOVE_COOKIES that actually means cookies. REMOVE_SITE_DATA has exactly the same semantics that REMOVE_COOKIES used to, with one exception: REMOVE_COOKIES included deleting cached strict transport security values. This functionality has been moved to REMOVE_CACHE. As a drive-by, this CL also moves a check against the kClearPluginLSODataEnabled pref out of webui (ClearBrowsingDataHandler) and into the BrowsingDataRemover itself, where it seems more likely to be effective.'	92628, 94334	Nothing but removal cached transport-security values should change.	http://codereview.chromium.org/7717023	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@99753 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

We have several places where a need to distinguish `real'' root CAs from user-added root CAs will be useful: 1) Monoscope wants to inspect correctly signed, but unknown certificates, but doesn''t want to deal with proxy MITM certificates. 2) HSTS is likely to add a method for pinning to a certificate, but we don''t want to break every proxy MITM with it. This change adds several lists of known, `real'' roots. These lists present an ongoing maintainance issue. However, in the event that the lists are incomplete in the future, we fail open. This is because roots not in these lists are treated as user-added and user-added roots have more authority than `real'' roots. In some sense, this is a problem because it might be a security issue that new roots are given too much authority. On the other hand, we''re not breaking things when we''re behind on updating the lists so the maintainance issue isn''t too pressing.'	none	none	http://codereview.chromium.org/6793041	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@80778 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

The views implementation of the little things floating around in the Omnibox uses nested views which are manually laid out by the location-bar code.  The Mac code has a variety of different implementations for these items, with the layout distributed across many files.  This change creates something called a "decoration" which is similar (different name because Mac has a strong sense of what a "view" is).  Decorations are kind of like a C++ NSCell, which the LocationBarViewMac::Layout() code will lay out.  The overall goal is to loosely parallel the views code for decorations and Layout(), so that future coders can do the right thing more easily. This CL converts the left-hand items, namely: - the location icon - the search-keyword bubble - the ev security bubble (new) The Layout() function does not yet deal with trimming things to fit when space is tight. location_bar_view_mac_unittest.mm was always a sham, so I''m going to stop pretending.'	41998	keyword-search mode shows appropriately.	http://codereview.chromium.org/2805070	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@52223 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

This CL fixes that by returning URLZONE_INTERNET for most of the URLs, as we cannot directly map them to internal/external URLs. The reason being Chrome would need to honor the security settings from IE based on the zone. We also disallow navigation in ChromeFrame for restricted URLs. This fixes bug http://b/issue?id=2059403 This CL also fixes the stray issues with cf:attach_external_tab being visible in the tab title at times. This can be easily reproduced if the tabs being opened are background tabs. To set the title we call Exec on the IOleCommandTarget exposed by the frame. This is queried off the IOleInPlaceSite interface which is maintained by the m_spInPlaceSite member variable in CComControlBase. This member is not set when the tab is opened as a background tab and only gets set when it is activated. The fix is to query the IOleInPlaceSite interface from the IOleClientSite interface if the m_spInPlaceSite  is not set.

A good portion of this CL is to support the new UI test. The IPC to notify the renderer of a redirect now includes a ResponseInfo struct allowing WebURLLoaderImpl to provide detailed response info (including response headers) to WebKit.  This isn''t strictly necessary, but I thought I''d include this to make the code more future proof. A cross origin restriction is added to SyncResourceHandler::OnRequestRedirected that mimics the code in WebCore/platform/network/cf/ResourceHandleCFNet.cpp. This is most unfortunate, and I filed a bug at bugs.webkit.org about the similar duplication of logic in WebCore. There seemed to be enough code paths leading to request cancellation at the ResourceDispatcher level that I couldn''t easily ensure that a request only gets cancelled once.  So, I added an is_cancelled flag to record if it is not necessary to send a ViewHostMsg_CancelRequest IPC.  This avoids some warnings in the ResourceDispatcherHost. To support my UI test, I needed to change URLRequestMockHttpJob to know how to serve redirects.  I moved URLRequestHttpJob::IsRedirectResponse to its base class, URLRequestJob so that the implementation could be shared.  This revealed a minor bug in URLRequest.  We were never resetting response_info_ upon following a redirect.  I added this code consolidated similar code from URLRequest::Redirect and URLRequest::RestartWithJob into a new PrepareToRestart method. To support my UI test, I added a "hit count" field to URLRequestFilter, and I added an associated automation IPC to query the value.  The test was a bit challenging to write because there is no way to tell the difference from JS. Before and after, it appears to JS as though the cross-origin redirect failed. However, the server can see the extra redirect request.  So, I simply record the number of hits against URLs of the form http://mock.http/foo, and use that to observe if any extra requests were made.  I implemented the new IPC message by extending the AutomationResourceMessageFilter.  This allowed me to trap the IPC message on the IO thread where it is safe to probe the URLRequestFilter.  I then changed the implementation of AutomationMsg_SetFilteredInet to work similarly. I revised URLRequestMockHTTPJob::GetOnDiskPath to support ports.  This actually allowed me to reuse URLRequestMockHTTPJob to service URLs in different security origins.  My test redirects from http://mock.http/ to http://mock.http:4000/. Please see the comments in cross-origin-redirect-blocked.html for details about how the test functions.

Both Curve and Skin have the issue that the format does not store any kind of length. So, I serialize a Skin to binary, followed but some other data in the same binary. Then at runtine I can deserialize the Skin and call  mySkin.setFromRaw(rawData, validOffset, INVALID_LENGTH) At which point there the possibility, how ever small, that the skin deserialization code will read into the next chunk of binary data in the RawData. Data that does not belong to it. The best solution IMO would be to add a length or count to the Skin and Curve formats since then, like Buffer, it would know exactly how much data is expected and if the length passed in does not match the length the format says it needs it would fail. Unfortunately, that would break all assets out there. This fix just makes sure that if we do get any kind of error the data is not left in the Skin or Curve like it was before. Should probably do the same with Buffer.			http://codereview.chromium.org/155599	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@20841 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

LoadData replaces LoadAlternateHTMLString, changing types to WebKit API types and allowing for more flexibility (supports loading non-HTML data). LoadHTMLString is modified to support some optional parameters. Note: Since WebFrame is going to soon be part of the WebKit API, it is OK style-wise for it to use optional parameters. This patch also includes a change to remove the securityInfo property from WebURLRequest.  I did this so that I could eliminate the need to pass a WebURLRequest to LoadData / LoadHTMLString. This also fixes a TODO of mine to eliminate this field on WebCore::ResourceRequest since securityInfo (SSL cert info) is really more of a response property.  It was only part of the request as a hack to support certain error pages.  I work around that by leveraging NavigationState in chrome/renderer. I added some templatized, implicit constructors to WebData for convenience.  I plan to make similar changes to WebCString and WebString in a future CL. This CL is a incremental step toward moving ResourceFetcher out of WebFrame.

The major change is that when a frame is loading a new page, the frame loader calls V8Proxy::clearWindowShell when it receives the first piece of data. At that point, the global object is detached from its current context. FrameLoader continues on preparing new environment, including creating new DOMWindow and security origin for the frame. When new DOMWindow is ready, the frame loader calls ScriptController::notifyNewDOMWindowReady(), which uses the existing global object to initialize the new context for the frame. Between detaching global from old context and creating new context using global, there should no JavaScript executed. The implication is that if the new page does not use JavaScript, its JS context is still created. But the overhead should be very small because V8 is warmed up already.			http://codereview.chromium.org/7838	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@3785 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

Also improved the mixed-content test to exercise the "block mixed-contents" preference and the show info-bar. For the new UI tests, added methods to tab_proxy and browser_proxy. The ones of most interest are GetLastNavigatinTime and WaitForNavigation that ensures we wait for a navigation to occur or have occured when taking actions that asynchronously trigger navigations. Resource loading: Added a flag to the response we get when loading a resource that indicates whether that resource was filtered (blocked or altered) by the security peer. We use this flag to notify back the browser when we report a load has been committed. This is so the SSL manager knows a frame has been filtered (in which case we have no cert info but should not consider that as unsafe).	2004		http://codereview.chromium.org/3165	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@2553 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

The Platform SDK sample code loads the DLL and looks up the function pointer table dynamically, probably because it was written back when Win 9x and NT used different DLLs (secur32.dll and security.dll).
