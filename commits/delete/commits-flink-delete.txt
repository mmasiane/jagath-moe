    [FLINK-3418] Don't run RocksDB copy utils in external process
    
    This was causing to many problems with security tokens and yarn. Now,
    let the RocksDB backup run in a thread but
    don't interrupt these Threads anymore on closing. The Threads will close
    themselves because the copy operation will fail because of a
    FileNotFoundException when the state directories are being cleaned up.
    
    This also removes the ExternalProcessRunner because it is not needed
    anymore and using it causes too many headaches.
    
    This closes #1687.

    [FLINK-2555] Properly pass security credentials in the Hadoop Input/Output format wrappers
    
    This is needed because the Hadoop IF/OF's are using Hadoop's FileSystem stack, which is using
    the security credentials passed in the JobConf / Job class in the getSplits() method.
    
    Note that access to secured Hadoop 1.x using Hadoop IF/OF's is not possible with this change.
    This limitation is due to missing methods in the old APIs.
    
    - Add some comments & change dependency scope to test

    [yarn] Major YARN-Client improvements
    - HDFS security token support
    - "ship/" directory to transfer files to all TaskManagers (user-files)
    - Log4j-based logging (YARN now respects the logging configuration)
    - the YARN-client deletes all "temp" files from HDFS.
    - The JVMs started by YARN now respect the configured JVM opts in the yaml-file
    - the JobManager webinterface shows the log file (e.g it is aware of the YARN-specific log-directory)
    - The YARN-client now creates a hidden ".yarn-jobmanager" with the address of the JobManager in YARN. users do not have to specify the -m argument anymore.
    - Fix a little bug with the JobManager's "cloud" model for taskManager with less that 1GB memory.
    - Tested on Cloudera Hadoop 5 Beta 2
    - Tested on Cloduera Hadoop 5 Beta 2 WITH CDH5-B2 Maven Dependencies.
    - Tested on Hadoop 2.2.0
    - Tested on Amazon EMR
