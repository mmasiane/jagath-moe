    Hide password in exception messages of SocksAuthRequest

    Related: #3504

    Motivation:

    There are two places in the SocksAuthRequest constructor where an
    IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a password as part of the
    exception message.

    This constitutes mishandling of confidential information, which can
    compromise user privacy and is flagged as critical by security scanners.

    Modifications:

    Mask the password in the exception messages

    Result:

    No unexpected password leak
