    Linux: remove the forced keyring unlock on password store initialization.
    It is no longer required for our gnome keyring integration to work correctly.
    
    This has the side effect of avoiding an unlock prompt unless a login form would
    actually be filled in by data in the keyring, lessening phishing vulnerability.
    
    In order to make this work correctly, we also have to be a little more careful
    about when we commit to using the keyring instead of the built-in store. In
    particular, because it can succeed without unlocking when there is no data to
    return (which is good, and avoids unexpected unlock prompts), we must require
    that we actually got some data before assuming that we can use the keyring.
    
    Note that we don't need to do any sort of merging or fall back to the built-in
    store in these cases, because we know it's empty - if it had any data in it, we
    would have migrated it, and we wouldn't be in this undecided state to begin
    with.
    
    This subtlety is probably the cause of some old repeated-unlock-prompt bugs
    that were masked by the unlock forcing. (Which was part of its point.)

    Disable registration of Breakpad's signal handler for Native Client
    
    This partially undoes r71459.
    
    This fixes a security vulnerability that occurs when the NaCl revision
    is updated to r4598 or later.  That revision changes NaCl's
    sel_main_chrome.c so that it no longer registers a signal handler, but
    instead leaves Breakpad's signal handler (registered by Chrome) in
    place.
    
    The vulnerability would allow NaCl untrusted code to escape NaCl's
    inner sandbox on x86-32 Linux.
    
    This is because although NaCl's signal handler knows how to safely
    handle faults from NaCl x86-32 sandboxed code, Breakpad's signal
    handler does not.  Breakpad's signal handler does not restore %gs.

    cros gdata: implement protocol handler for viewing gdata files
    - this re-implements the previous implementation of chrome://gdata
    - create new scheme gdata:// to view contents of gdata files
    - url has format gdata://viewfile/<gdata_resource_id>/<gdata_file_name>
    - add gdata protocol handler as a hostname filter for url requests during
      initialization of GDataFileSystem, and remove it in destructor
    - reading of file contents is done in streaming manner, without the need to
      store entire file contents in memory before responding to url request
    - this also mitigates (if not fixes) the security risk imposed by chrome://
      scheme

    net: move HSTS preloaded and pinning info out of code.
    
    (This is a reland of r132012, which was reverted in r132016 because it broke
    net_unittests on ChromeOS.)
    
    This change moves information about HSTS preloaded and public key pinning, that
    were previously written in code, into external files that can be consumed by
    other programs. Those files are converted by a program (that is not part of the
    build process) into hsts_preloaded.h.
    
    In order to make this change easier to review, hsts_preloaded.h was created by
    concatenating public_key_hashes.h and transport_security_state.cc. Therefore,
    the diffs will show where the new, generated file differs from the previous
    code.
    
    public_key_hashes.h and public_key_hashes_check.go are removed and subsumed by
    hsts_preloaded.h.

    Enable positional parameters for base::vsnprintf and base::vswprintf on Windows.
    
    
    This is to avoid bugs like http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=118064 in the future. Positional parameters are supported by the VC++ runtime via the set of "_p" flavored printf-like routines. MSDN claims that "By default the positional functions behave identically to the non position ones, if no positional formatting is present."
    
    There is a little difference that require some attention though. Currently base::vsnprintf and base::vswprintf wrappers use "_s" functions (so called "security enhanced versions"). Judging by looking at the CRT code, _p functions implement the same checks as _s ones do. The base wrappers call the CRT routines so that count == (sizeOfBuffer - 1). This reduces most of the additional code in _vsnprintf_s (comparing to _vsprintf_p) to no-op. Namely:
    
    1. When truncation happens the tail of the buffer is filled with a pattern:
    
        _SECURECRT__FILL_STRING(string, sizeInBytes, count + 1);
    
    This does not happen in our case because sizeInBytes == count + 1.
    
    2. The special case check shown below was never true since sizeInBytes != count in our case:
    
        if (count == 0 && string == NULL && sizeInBytes == 0)
    
    3. The following checks in _vsnprintf_s are also implemented in _vsnprintf_helper:
    
    _VALIDATE_RETURN(format != NULL, EINVAL, -1);
    _VALIDATE_RETURN(string != NULL && sizeInBytes > 0, EINVAL, -1);
    
    The only remaining difference between _vsnprintf_s and _vsprintf_p is that the former NULL-terminates the buffer and fills the rest a pattern if _vsnprintf_helper failed because of any reason other than truncation:
    
        string[0] = 0;
        _SECURECRT__FILL_STRING(string, sizeInBytes, 1);
    
    This CL write NULL to the end of the buffer in any error case (truncation or other reason).

    bluetooth: add support for Passkey pairing
    
    Bluetooth 2.1 onwards defines a pairing mechanism where a device
    without capability for Input or Display, and that declines Passkey-less
    pairing for security reasons, can require us to enter a six-digit
    numeric Passkey to perform pairing.
    
    This will, of course, never happen.
    
    But in case it does, implement support for it. This requires us knowing
    whether the device is expecting a PIN Code or Passkey, and in the latter
    case converting the String we receive from JavaScript into a numeric to
    return.

    Fix incomplete teardown of demuxer.
    
    I ran into an issue with PipelineIntegrationTests where one of the
    security videos was causing ~FileDataSource to DCHECK complain about
    file_ never being torn down.
    
    Tracing this back, it's because we return NULL for the demuxer when
    an error is encountered. This prevents demuxer->Stop() from being called
    which leaves the data source in an unhappy state.

    aura: Touch state file after first browser is ready.
    
    This creates a chromeos::InitialBrowserWindowObserver class
    for Aura that replicates some behavior for tests that's
    currently performed by the X window manager: when the first
    browser window is created,
    /var/run/state/windowmanager/initial-chrome-window-mapped is
    touched (the window manager actually writes the window's ID
    to the file, but that doesn't make sense under Aura and
    luckily doesn't appear to be depended on by any tests).
    
    This fixes Chrome OS's security_ProfilePermissions.BWSI and
    security_ProfilePermissions.login autotests, which otherwise
    time out when run against an Aura build.
    
    I'm also moving existing X-window-manager-related files that
    are currently in the chromeos/ directory to
    chromeos/legacy_window_manager/.

    Turn on content-security-policy for chrome://syncpromo webui page.
    
    This recent page was nearly in the correct form as-is, but needed a
    small number of changes about how it includes script resources before
    it could be removed from the list of excluded entryponts.

    options: fix up vertical spacing
    
    issues:
    1. there is extraneous padding between sections in some cases (i.e. when the top or bottom element has top or bottom margin). Solution: don't apply top margin for top element or bottom margin for bottom element.
    2. the top section h3 on each top level options page jiggles when you switch to that page (each has a different vertical alignment relative to the page title). Solution: set vertical alignment of sections on the section h3 rather than section content (content will in turn align to h3 baseline).
    3. the security button on the advanced page is too close to the checkbox. Solution: add .section-group div.

    Rename REMOVE_COOKIES to REMOVE_SITE_DATA (which will explicitly include REMOVE_LSO_DATA).
    
    There's no case in the current codebase when we want to remove _only_ LSO data, and no case where we want to remove cookies, but _not_ LSO data. There are many instances of building removal masks that binary-OR REMOVE_LSO_DATA and REMOVE_COOKIES together; this CL formalizes that by dropping the extra enum value.
    
    Moreover, we talk about "cookies" differently when targeting users on the one hand, and developers on the other. REMOVE_COOKIES is a developer-facing name with a user-facing value, which is confusing. Renaming the current functionality to REMOVE_SITE_DATA is much more explicit, and will enable us to _just_ remove cookies at some point in the future via a REMOVE_COOKIES that actually means cookies.
    
    REMOVE_SITE_DATA has exactly the same semantics that REMOVE_COOKIES used to, with one exception: REMOVE_COOKIES included deleting cached strict transport security values. This functionality has been moved to REMOVE_CACHE.
    
    As a drive-by, this CL also moves a check against the kClearPluginLSODataEnabled pref out of webui (ClearBrowsingDataHandler) and into the BrowsingDataRemover itself, where it seems more likely to be effective.
    
    BUG=92628, 94334
    TEST=Nothing but removal cached transport-security values should change.

    Improve Autofill heuristics when detecting labels from previous elements.
    
    Support HTML like """Name <span class="required">*</span> <input type="text" name="name">"""
    
    Of course, pull at a thread and...
    
    Other changes also included to avoid regressions:
    
     * When parsing address fields for heuristics, we try to skip over unlabeled fields in the middle of an address.  Updated the code not to also skip over unlabeled fields at the *end* of an address, as these might be part of a different section entirely.
    
     * Tighten the credit card number regex to require the word "card".
    
     * Add "csc" to the credit card security code regex.
    
     * When inferring labels based on <div> structure, be willing to scan up the tree past the closest parent that is a <div>.
    
     * Also when inferring labels based on <div> structure, we previously would only stop early if we were about to escape from a <table> element.  Also stop early if we are about to escape from a <fieldset> element.  If we see either of these elements, we expect the field label to be contained with the element.
    
     * Allow <label> elements to misuse the 'for' attribute to specify the element's name rather than its id.

    Add chrome-extension:// to the list of allowed urls for all internal/webui
    Content Security Policy rules. This is necessary to allow a trusted
    accessibility component extension (ChromeVox) to inject script tags into
    webui pages.
    
    This will not hurt security because user_script_slave.cc already has a
    check to prevent arbitrary extensions from loading on these pages.
    Only component extensions will be allowed.

    Add Safari spoofing when visiting the Silverlight install/update page in Mac Chrome.
    
    The update flow for Silverlight on the Mac takes the user to a page that does UA detection, and provides Mac Chrome users a page that makes it much less clear that they should update (and how to) just because it's not one of the officially supported platforms. Spoof as a supported browser on that page to increase the chances that users will successfully complete the update, since not updating is a potential security issue.

    Add content-security-policy (CSP) to chrome://flags.
    
    CSP provides a second line of defense against XSS flaws in the underlying page
    by requiring all scripts to come from well-known external sources.  This CL
    moves the JS formerly in flags.html into new file flags.js, and adds some JS
    to attach handlers formerly set by inline onclick="" attributes.

    Apply content-security-policy to chrome://plugins page.  This involves
    converting all inline javascript to external .js files, since CSP can't
    determine whether inline script is legitimate or an XSS.
    
    We move the jstemplate_compiled.js file to the share resources directory,
    since several WEBUI components will need this, and update the compile.py
    script that produces it to write to this new location.
    
    We move the javascript out of plugins.html to plugins.js; note that the

    third_party/libevent: don't touch base unless needed.
    
    See referenced bug. I'm assuming that we don't actually have active events
    outliving the base, but just that the accesses of the base pointer outside of
    the conditional were premature.
    
    This change makes it so that we don't touch the base object unless the event
    really is active. This suggests that there's no security problem here and
    the crashes are those that are hitting pages that have been unmapped.

    Pre-requisites needed before applying content-security-policy to the HTML options page.  CSP is a second line of defense in case someone introduces an XSS in one of these pages.
    
    The changes to jstemplate_builder are to allow the template scripts
    to be served as resources where possible, and to return JS as well as
    HTML in the one case where the script is to be dynamically generated.
    
    The other changes are to combine the options javascript files into a
    single large file resource and to serve it from under chrome://settings.
    This satisfies the "no inline" rule and options.html can script src="" it.

    net: add ability to distinguish user-added root CAs.
    
    We have several places where a need to distinguish `real' root CAs from
    user-added root CAs will be useful:
      1) Monoscope wants to inspect correctly signed, but unknown certificates, but
         doesn't want to deal with proxy MITM certificates.
      2) HSTS is likely to add a method for pinning to a certificate, but we don't
         want to break every proxy MITM with it.
    
    This change adds several lists of known, `real' roots. These lists present an
    ongoing maintainance issue. However, in the event that the lists are incomplete
    in the future, we fail open. This is because roots not in these lists are
    treated as user-added and user-added roots have more authority than `real'
    roots.
    
    In some sense, this is a problem because it might be a security issue that new
    roots are given too much authority. On the other hand, we're not breaking
    things when we're behind on updating the lists so the maintainance issue isn't
    too pressing.

    Disable registration of Breakpad's signal handler for Native Client
    
    This partially undoes r71459.
    
    This fixes a security vulnerability that occurs when the NaCl revision
    is updated to r4598 or later.  That revision changes NaCl's
    sel_main_chrome.c so that it no longer registers a signal handler, but
    instead leaves Breakpad's signal handler (registered by Chrome) in
    place.
    
    The vulnerability would allow NaCl untrusted code to escape NaCl's
    inner sandbox on x86-32 Linux.
    
    This is because although NaCl's signal handler knows how to safely
    handle faults from NaCl x86-32 sandboxed code, Breakpad's signal
    handler does not.  Breakpad's signal handler does not restore %gs.

    Instead of initializing NSS before the sandbox is engaged this loads the

    Fix a typo I introduced (IceTea should be IcedTea) in my last commit here.
    Also bump minimum version to 1.9.4; both Fedora and Ubuntu have released
    1.9.4 as a security update. (Note -- there may be another one imminent, in
    which case I'll use 1.9.5 as appropriate).

    Add facility to fix about: and file: links from chrome:// pages.
    
    Currently, about: links all go to about:blank. This fixes that for left clicks and middle clicks, although context menu navigations (e.g. open in new tab) still won't work.
    
    This also "fixes" file: links in the same way. Currently, file links already work as is, but after we make --new-chrome-ui-security-model the default, they will cease to work without this fix. Context menu navigations will, however, continue to work.
    
    The fix is currently applied to the history page and one link in settings.

    Changing the security model for "chrome" URLs
    
    This patch changes the security model for "chrome" URLs to make implementing
    some features in DOMUI easier. Instead of registering "chrome" as a NoAccess
    and a Local scheme, we register it as a DisplayIsolated scheme. That should
    have the effects outlined in this email:

    Two minor changes to the use of FormatMessageA in Win32ErrorLogMessage:
    - Follow the MSDN advice and use FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS to avoid security issues and to prevent getting back ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER for any message that has inserts.  This is always the right thing since this function provides no arguments for inserts.
    - Don't specify a language identifier, thereby allowing FormatMessageA to make many sensible attempts to find a string in some suitable language.

    Fix multi-round authentication.
    
    In the case of Negotiate, authentication can look like
    
    C: GET
    S: 401, WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate
    
    C: GET, WWW-Authorization: Negotiate <client_token_1>
    S: 401, WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate <server_token_1>
    
    C: GET, WWW-Authorization: Negotiate <client_token_2>
    S: 401, WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate <server_token_2>
    
    on that third challenge, the handler was reported as being in "the final round" and this was treated as a rejection of the authentication attempt. After that, the new challenge token was used by a new auth handler that hadn't established a security context, and an ERR_INVALID_HANDLE would be returned.
    
    This CL also does some prep work to correctly handle the "stale=true" value for Digest authentication, but I decided to defer the HttpAuthCache changes needed for that to a separate CL since this was large enough.
    
    BUG=53282
    TEST=net_unittests. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to set up a proxy/server to do more than two auth challenges, but this does happen in the wild.

    Restrict unsafe URLs in Chrome Frame
    
    Further tighten down what URLs can be loaded in Chrome Frame.
    Based on the feedback from the security review and code
    inspection, restrict about: scheme only to about:blank
    and about:version by default. Factor out logic blocking logic
    including for URL zone checking so that all ActiveX, ActiveDoc
    and NPAPI will follow the same path. As a result we now block
    restricted URL zones in NPAPI instance as well.
    
    Another side effect of this refactoring is that the registry
    flag, EnableGcfProtocol, is replaced by AllowUnsafeURLs. If
    If this flag is set, then all the security related checking
    is turned off.

    [Mac] First part of Omnibox decoration refactor.  Enable ev bubble.
    
    The views implementation of the little things floating around in the
    Omnibox uses nested views which are manually laid out by the
    location-bar code.  The Mac code has a variety of different
    implementations for these items, with the layout distributed across
    many files.  This change creates something called a "decoration" which
    is similar (different name because Mac has a strong sense of what a
    "view" is).  Decorations are kind of like a C++ NSCell, which the
    AutocompleteTextFieldCell handles generically and the
    LocationBarViewMac::Layout() code will lay out.  The overall goal is
    to loosely parallel the views code for decorations and Layout(), so
    that future coders can do the right thing more easily.
    
    This CL converts the left-hand items, namely:
     - the location icon
     - the search-keyword bubble
     - the ev security bubble (new)
    The Layout() function does not yet deal with trimming things to fit
    when space is tight.
    
    location_bar_view_mac_unittest.mm was always a sham, so I'm going to
    stop pretending.

    Add --allow-scripting-gallery command line switch to allow extensions
    and scripts to run on the Chrome Extensions Gallery site. There are
    security concerns in enabling this and so it remains off by default,
    but this is needed for automation testing of the gallery.
    
    Cleanup: Have UserScriptSlave::InjectScripts() return void instead of a bogus bool.
    
    TEST=Visit http://chrome.google.com/extensions, check that content scripts work when the command-line switch is given, and are not injected when the switch is not given.

    Remove a possible race in the SUID sandbox (minor)
    
    The SUID sandbox can be used to set the oom_adj value for non-dumpable
    processes owned by the same user. When doing so, we previously first
    checked the directory owner and then opened the oom_adj file. In between
    the check and the open, the process could have died and another process
    could have taken that PID value. We would then adjust the OOM value of
    the wrong process.
    
    Given how PIDs are allocated, this is very hard to exploit and, even
    then, a minor security issue at best, but we can avoid the issue
    entirely with openat.

    Changes FormatURL to not strip http if the host starts with ftp or https[!a-z]. This
    is necessitated by the omnibox treating ftp.www.com as
    ftp://www.com as well as security problems.
    
    I also changed FormatURL to always reset the supplied
    url_parse::Parsed. I did this as in writing my test I uncovered a long
    standing bug where a component wasn't getting reset. It seems much
    safer to always reset than rely on all code paths setting every
    component.

    Make the browser survive massive data: URIs, via various techniques:
    1) Drop the URL limit from 10MB to 2MB. The browser survives without this,
    but that final tweaks makes the whole data: URI attack fairly smooth (on my
    admittedly powerful machine).
    2) Elide the title string at kMaxTitleChars. We already have a hard title limit
    but there was a path whereby the title is implied by the URL (e.g. file: and
    data: etc).
    3) For massive URLs, limit the length shown in URL bar. We need to support them,
    because someone might redirect to a data: URI with e.g. an image in it.
    However, attempting to show them would kill the browser. We can't elide them
    because eliding URLs is a security risk (and would lead to correctness issues
    with an edit/press enter cycle). So we show at least the origin (minus path) or
    just the scheme for data: URIs

    Be more restrictive when finding file names for libraries that need patching.
    This avoids false positives if the directory name matches one of the well-known
    library names (e.g. ld).
    
    False positives not only result in a performance hit at startup, because we
    are now trying to instrument libraries that don't actually contain any system
    calls; but even worse than this, we could try to instrument system calls in
    the sandboxing code itself. And those system calls are deliberately coded so
    that they will not get rewritten.
    
    Fortunately, none of this is a security problem. If we accidentally rewrite
    system calls that weren't supposed to be rewritten, we will just crash on
    startup.

    Tie the lifetime of persisted transport-security metatdata to clearing cookies,
    thus giving the user control over it.
    This involved adding in a "creation" date to the metadata so we can respect the
    user's choice of how far back to go when deleting browsing data. Care is taken
    to handle older metadata without the creation date set.
    Also fix a bug whereby we weren't making sure to persist the removed metadata
    when it expires.

    Replace __MSG_some_name__ template within extension css files with localized messages.
    
    We avoid replacing messages within html and js extension files for security reasons. Also, developers can already localize messages in html/js using chrome.i18n.getMessage calls.
    
    TEST=Localize extension, try body{direction: __MSG_@@bidi_reversed_dir__;} in popup.css, while using non-rtl locale. Text should be alligned to the right (as if we were using rtl locale).

    Change the javascript context used by the loadtimes extension.  It should be
    using the CurrentContext, not the EnteredContext so that it grabs the right
    object based on the frame being called.

    is already protected from XSS access.

    Add stub functions for chrome.* APIs in content scripts.
    
    Most of the extensions API is not supported in content scripts for security
    purposes. Instead the typical pattern is to use messaging between content
    scripts and a background page which executes them on behalf of the script.
    This is not immediately obvious to many extension developers, so this
    change adds an error message to help them better understand what's going on.

    Add mime-type for SVG to lighttpd.conf for run_webkit_tests.
    
    Formerly, the HTTP server sent an SVG file as application/octet-stream, which caused the following layout test failures. This change fixes them.
    
    - LayoutTests/http/tests/xmlhttprequest/xmlhttprequest-image-not-loaded-svg.svg (issue 10387)

    Currently in full tab mode IE displays the security zone as Unknown. This CL fixes that by returning URLZONE_INTERNET for most of the URLs, as we cannot directly map them to internal/external URLs. The reason being Chrome would need to honor the security settings from IE based on the zone.
    
    We also disallow navigation in ChromeFrame for restricted URLs.
    
    This fixes bug http://b/issue?id=2059403
    
    This CL also fixes the stray issues with cf:attach_external_tab being visible in the tab title at times.
    This can be easily reproduced if the tabs being opened are background tabs. To set the title we call
    Exec on the IOleCommandTarget exposed by the frame. This is queried off the IOleInPlaceSite interface which
    is maintained by the m_spInPlaceSite member variable in CComControlBase. This member is not set when the tab
    is opened as a background tab and only gets set when it is activated. The fix is to query the IOleInPlaceSite
    interface from the IOleClientSite interface if the m_spInPlaceSite  is not set.
    
    This fixes http://b/issue?id=2119243

    This provides us a little wiggle room in the future in

    Strict transport security: add checkbox to clear state.
    
    This patches add a checkbox to the "Clear Browsing Data" dialog which
    clears the STS state when checked. Since we don't timestamp our
    entries (for now at least, should we?), the duration selected has no
    effect: we always clear everything.
    
    Mac doesn't appear to have a dialog for this yet, so no Mac specific
    changes.

    Rebaseline LayoutTests/fast/xmlhttprequest/xmlhttprequest-nonexistent-file.html for Windows and Linux.  Chrome allows xhr's to local directories (if the security origin of the document is file://) and Safari does not, so when testXHRDirectory is run on Safari hits an error handler, but returns a real result in Chrome.  Mac is still marked as failing because of unimplemented test shell features (See http://crbug.com/20458 for more details).

    Linux sandbox: fix security issue.
    
    (Reported by Julien Tinnes)
    
    Because the chroot helper process and the zygote share a FILES
    structure, the latter can race the former and change the value of cwd
    before it does chroot("."). Because of this, the zygote could chroot
    into a directory of its choosing. Once there, it could setup hardlinks
    to SUID binaries and possibly make them misbehave if they weren't
    sufficiently paranoid.
    
    This possibility should have been migigated by the removal of
    dangerous environment variables. However, we had to reinstate them in
    order to pass LD_LIBRARY_PATH because some setups don't have ld.so
    setup to use /usr/lib32 and also for ffmpeg.

    Enable new FTP for Windows TestShell so that the results of block-test.html are
    the same across platforms.  WTC tells me that it should be ready to go, and it
    anyways is only exercised by these two security/block-test*.html tests.
    
    Also, add back the fix from r22651.
    
    Extend that fix a bit so that when we do not have a special mapping, we just spit out the existing error code value.  This way, if we get an unexpected result, the output will tell us what the original error code was.  This change doesn't impact any layout tests.

    Add plumbing for allowing the renderer to intercept and cancel redirects before
    they are sent.
    
    A good portion of this CL is to support the new UI test.
    
    The IPC to notify the renderer of a redirect now includes a ResponseInfo struct
    allowing WebURLLoaderImpl to provide detailed response info (including response
    headers) to WebKit.  This isn't strictly necessary, but I thought I'd include
    this to make the code more future proof.
    
    A cross origin restriction is added to SyncResourceHandler::OnRequestRedirected
    that mimics the code in WebCore/platform/network/cf/ResourceHandleCFNet.cpp.
    This is most unfortunate, and I filed a bug at bugs.webkit.org about the
    similar duplication of logic in WebCore.
    
    There seemed to be enough code paths leading to request cancellation at the
    ResourceDispatcher level that I couldn't easily ensure that a request only gets
    cancelled once.  So, I added an is_cancelled flag to record if it is not
    necessary to send a ViewHostMsg_CancelRequest IPC.  This avoids some warnings
    in the ResourceDispatcherHost.
    
    To support my UI test, I needed to change URLRequestMockHttpJob to know how to
    serve redirects.  I moved URLRequestHttpJob::IsRedirectResponse to its base
    class, URLRequestJob so that the implementation could be shared.  This revealed
    a minor bug in URLRequest.  We were never resetting response_info_ upon
    following a redirect.  I added this code consolidated similar code from
    URLRequest::Redirect and URLRequest::RestartWithJob into a new PrepareToRestart
    method.
    
    To support my UI test, I added a "hit count" field to URLRequestFilter, and I
    added an associated automation IPC to query the value.  The test was a bit
    challenging to write because there is no way to tell the difference from JS.
    Before and after, it appears to JS as though the cross-origin redirect failed.
    However, the server can see the extra redirect request.  So, I simply record
    the number of hits against URLs of the form http://mock.http/foo, and use that
    to observe if any extra requests were made.  I implemented the new IPC message
    by extending the AutomationResourceMessageFilter.  This allowed me to trap the
    IPC message on the IO thread where it is safe to probe the URLRequestFilter.  I
    then changed the implementation of AutomationMsg_SetFilteredInet to work
    similarly.
    
    I revised URLRequestMockHTTPJob::GetOnDiskPath to support ports.  This actually
    allowed me to reuse URLRequestMockHTTPJob to service URLs in different security
    origins.  My test redirects from http://mock.http/ to http://mock.http:4000/.
    
    Please see the comments in cross-origin-redirect-blocked.html for details about
    how the test functions.

    Linux: add GYP variable to use the system libpng.
    
    Since our packagers have been requesting that we support using more
    system libraries, I'm starting to commit these sorts of changes.
    However, please note that one MUST NOT use the system libpng on, at
    least, Ubuntu 64-bit. Because Chromium on Linux is still a 32-bit
    build we end up with the 32-bit compat versions of libraries and, on
    Ubuntu at least, this includes a very old libpng with security issues.

    Some security fixes for Skin and Curve deseralization.
    
    Both Curve and Skin have the issue that the format
    does not store any kind of length.
    
    So, I serialize a Skin to binary, followed but some other data
    in the same binary. Then at runtine I can deserialize the Skin
    and call  mySkin.setFromRaw(rawData, validOffset, INVALID_LENGTH)
    
    At which point there the possibility, how ever small, that
    the skin deserialization code will read into the next
    chunk of binary data in the RawData. Data that does not belong
    to it.
    
    The best solution IMO would be to add a length or count to
    the Skin and Curve formats since then, like Buffer, it would
    know exactly how much data is expected and if the length
    passed in does not match the length the format says it needs
    it would fail.
    
    Unfortunately, that would break all assets out there.
    
    This fix just makes sure that if we do get any kind of error
    the data is not left in the Skin or Curve like it was before.
    
    Should probably do the same with Buffer.

    Add Reload and LoadData methods to WebFrame.  LoadData replaces
    LoadAlternateHTMLString, changing types to WebKit API types and
    allowing for more flexibility (supports loading non-HTML data).
    
    LoadHTMLString is modified to support some optional parameters.
    
    Note: Since WebFrame is going to soon be part of the WebKit API,
    it is OK style-wise for it to use optional parameters.
    
    This patch also includes a change to remove the securityInfo
    property from WebURLRequest.  I did this so that I could eliminate
    the need to pass a WebURLRequest to LoadData / LoadHTMLString.
    This also fixes a TODO of mine to eliminate this field on
    WebCore::ResourceRequest since securityInfo (SSL cert info) is
    really more of a response property.  It was only part of the
    request as a hack to support certain error pages.  I work around
    that by leveraging NavigationState in chrome/renderer.
    
    I added some templatized, implicit constructors to WebData for
    convenience.  I plan to make similar changes to WebCString and
    WebString in a future CL.
    
    This CL is a incremental step toward moving ResourceFetcher out
    of WebFrame.

    Revert change (r10357, http://codereview.chromium.org/21477) that removes the
    registration of URL Protocol.  The original change broke launching of chrome when
    it's the default browser on Vista from some programs (e.g. Google Desktop).
    The reason for removing this is that we thought it would be a potential security threat
    but it seems like this is how other browsers do this and the user gets presented by
    a warning dialog anyway.

    Fix data url security tests.
    
    The problem was that the security token in V8 was set to the string
    "null" for all data urls.  Therefore, the access check succeeded.  The
    cause of the regression was that securityOrigin's toString
    implementation was changed in WebKit to return "null" instead of
    String().

    SSLPolicy fix: Step 9 of 9 (hopefully!).
    
    Change our algorithm for computing the state of our SSL security indicators.  Previously, we were computing this state for a single navigation entry.  Although this matches other browsers, it fails to take the same-origin policy into account.  For example, if one tab is contaminated with insecure content, that insecure content can spread to all the tabs in the same security origin.

    DEFER a test that is broken upstream.
    
    The test tries to load a file:/// URL from a data: URL.  This isn't allowed
    in Chromium but it is in Safari.  The test really doesn't have anything to
    do with security checks so we should fix the test upstream instead.
    
    I'm deleting the existing pixel baseline because they're wrong (missing the image because of the security check mentioned above).

    Add a copy of DOM checker for testing. DOM checker is a tool to help automate
    domain security policy enforcement.
    
    This copy of DOM checker was fetched from:
    http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/dom_checker/
    
    Some values in dom_config.js have been changed. There have been no other
    modifications.
    
    In order to automate this test, there will need to be a few more small changes.
    To more easily see what changes have been made for Chromium, I'm first checking
    in a clean copy.

    This CL adds a way to specify the security info when canceling a URLRequest.
    This allows to tag a request on the renderer side with its security info.  It is useful for the "frame info" dialog.
    When showing that dialog for blocked frames, the security info can be retrieved and users can see the cert details for the blocked frame.
    
    TEST=Open a page containing a frame served over bad HTTPS.  The frame is blocked (replaced with a warning message). Right-click, select "Frame info". The dialog should have a "show cert" button which when pressed should show the frame's bad cert.

    Update te way test shell cleans up on exit.
    
    It turns out that the LayoutTestControllers are only reset
    when a test is started.  Some tests leave sub-windows open
    (e.g. http/tests/security/aboutBlank/security-context-window-open.html)
    When these tests are run through the purify runner - which
    only runs one test per test shell - the effect is that the
    LayoutTestController does not get cleaned up.

    Clean up the proxy code for handling frame navigation.
    
    When a frame navigates to a new page, the old context handle is disposed, and the global proxy object is detached from
    the old context. A new context is created using the global proxy object. However, the security token is not created
    because, at this point, the security origin is not updated to new URL.
    When the new document is ready, V8Proxy updates the security token using the security origin of the document.
    
    Our code relies on the fact that ScriptController::clearWindowShell be called only when the frame loads a page, but not at closing time.

This matches the WebKit version function dumpFramesAsText in WebKitTools/DumpRenderTree/win/DumpRenderTree.cpp, see http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/WebKitTools/DumpRenderTree/win/DumpRenderTree.cpp?rev=34719#L306.
    
    This fixes layout test LayoutTests/http/tests/security/cross-origin-xsl-BLOCKED.html as it expects a totally empty iframe.

      LayoutTests/http/tests/security/listener/xss-JSTargetNode-onclick-addEventListener.html
    
    In WebKit r33979 all these layout tests had
    
      alert("document.domain: " + window.document.domain);
    
    changed to
    
      try {
        alert("document.domain: " + window.document.domain);
      } catch(e) {
      }
    
    causing the document.domain access error to no longer be reported. Rebaselining the tests does not compromize what they are testing as if window.domain was accessible the output would change causing failures.

    Another attempt at fixing the flash security issue surrounding
    window.location.
    
    This change disallows shadowing of window and location both when using
    var declarations and when defining accessors.  Using 'var location =
    stuff' will cause a navigation.  This is consistent with what Firefox
    does.
    
    Also, introduce an explicit valueOf function on location objects so
    that implicit string conversions cannot be intercepted to fake the
    current location reported by window.location.

    The original expectations included a security access error where the source was about:blank, but as soon as an about:blank is written to it is supposed to get the URL of the script performing the write. This behaviour matches the error messages seen in Firefox and Internet Explorer.

    Background:
    1. We can tell chrome to "always open this type of file" when
    downloading. This is disabled for executable for security
    reasons.
    
    2. When downloading an executable files we download
    a .download instead.
    
    -=-=
    
    The problem is that the "always open this type of file" is enabled
    for executables during the download because we check the extension
    of the file to know if it's an executable or not, and during download
    we see .download, and we don't consider it an executable.
    
    The fix is to look at the "original_name" when it's present to get
    the extension of the real file, not the .download.

    Make sure it's possible to download to a network share.
    
    The function to move the file was failing to set the
    security descriptor. Now we use SHFileOperation, which
    has a flag to do everything we want.
    
    Eventually we might want to display ui on errors and
    use the ui features of SHFileOperation, but for the
    1.0 build we want to stick to a smaller and less risky
    change.

    Second part of split window support in the binding part.
    The major change is that when a frame is loading a new page,
    the frame loader calls V8Proxy::clearWindowShell when it receives
    the first piece of data. At that point, the global object is
    detached from its current context. FrameLoader continues on
    preparing new environment, including creating new DOMWindow
    and security origin for the frame. When new DOMWindow is ready,
    the frame loader calls ScriptController::notifyNewDOMWindowReady(),
    which uses the existing global object to initialize the new context
    for the frame. Between detaching global from old context and
    creating new context using global, there should no JavaScript
    executed.
    
    The implication is that if the new page does not use JavaScript,
    its JS context is still created. But the overhead should be very
    small because V8 is warmed up already.

    This CL adds new UI tests for the SSL UI.
    Some more info:
    
    SSL UI Tests:
    Added new tests for redirects and frames.
    Also improved the mixed-content test to exercise the "block mixed-contents" preference and the show info-bar.
    
    Automation:
    For the new UI tests, added methods to tab_proxy and browser_proxy. The ones of most interest are GetLastNavigatinTime and WaitForNavigation that ensures we wait for a navigation to occur or have occured when taking actions that asynchronously trigger navigations.
    
    Resource loading:
    Added a flag to the response we get when loading a resource that indicates whether that resource was filtered (blocked or altered) by the security peer. We use this flag to notify back the browser when we report a load has been committed.
    This is so the SSL manager knows a frame has been filtered (in which case we have no cert info but should not consider that as unsafe).

    Experimental integration of delta compression content encoding
    
    
    The command line option "sdch-enable" enables support of sdch
    and automtic lazy download of dictionaries.  Optionally it
    can select a singular domain to work from.
    
    By default, all domains are enabled when the flag is used.
    "-sdch-enable=".google.com"  Enables it only for Google.
    
    When the switch is not set on the command line, all this
    code is completely disabled.
    
    Still TBD:
    a) Finish implementation of security details (much of it is in place)
    b) Add tests for security details.

    There are still some rough edges and hardcoded

    We can link with secur32.lib and call the SSPI functions directly.
    The Platform SDK sample code loads the DLL and looks up the function
    pointer table dynamically, probably because it was written back when
