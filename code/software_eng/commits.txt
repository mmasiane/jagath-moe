    Linux: remove the forced keyring unlock on password store initialization.
    It is no longer required for our gnome keyring integration to work correctly.
    
    This has the side effect of avoiding an unlock prompt unless a login form would
    actually be filled in by data in the keyring, lessening phishing vulnerability.
    
    In order to make this work correctly, we also have to be a little more careful
    about when we commit to using the keyring instead of the built-in store. In
    particular, because it can succeed without unlocking when there is no data to
    return (which is good, and avoids unexpected unlock prompts), we must require
    that we actually got some data before assuming that we can use the keyring.
    
    Note that we don't need to do any sort of merging or fall back to the built-in
    store in these cases, because we know it's empty - if it had any data in it, we
    would have migrated it, and we wouldn't be in this undecided state to begin
    with.
    
    This subtlety is probably the cause of some old repeated-unlock-prompt bugs
    that were masked by the unlock forcing. (Which was part of its point.)

    Disable registration of Breakpad's signal handler for Native Client
    
    This partially undoes r71459.
    
    This fixes a security vulnerability that occurs when the NaCl revision
    is updated to r4598 or later.  That revision changes NaCl's
    sel_main_chrome.c so that it no longer registers a signal handler, but
    instead leaves Breakpad's signal handler (registered by Chrome) in
    place.
    
    The vulnerability would allow NaCl untrusted code to escape NaCl's
    inner sandbox on x86-32 Linux.
    
    This is because although NaCl's signal handler knows how to safely
    handle faults from NaCl x86-32 sandboxed code, Breakpad's signal
    handler does not.  Breakpad's signal handler does not restore %gs.
    
    BUG=http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=1607
    TEST=assertion to be added on the NaCl side (http://codereview.chromium.org/6798008/)
