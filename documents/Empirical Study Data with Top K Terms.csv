This CL initializes a single-threaded apartment on the main thread in the daemon and configures COM security in the following way: - The daemon authenticates that all data received is from the expected client. - The daemon can impersonate clients to check their identity but cannot act on their behalf. - The caller's identity on every call (Dynamic cloaking). - Activations where the activated COM server would run under the daemon's identity are prohibited.	daemon 5; extension 4; native 3; calling 3; com 3; identity 3; on 3; of 2; host 2; which 2; it 2; their 2; security 2; s 2; be 1; 	137696		https://codereview.chromium.org/12378078	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@186245 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

More specifically: - Add net/android/keystore.h, which provides native functions to operate on JNI references pointing to java.security.PrivateKey objects provided by the platform. I.e.: net::android::GetPrivateKeyType() net::android::SignWithPrivateKey() Also provide a function that can get the system's own EVP_PKEY* handle corresponding to a given PrivateKey object. This uses reflection and should *only* be used for RSA private keys when running on Android 4.0 and 4.1, in order to route around a platform bug that was only fixed in 4.2. net::android::GetOpenSSLSytstemHandleForPrivateKey() See the comments in this source file for mode details: net/android/java/org/chromium/net/AndroidKeyStore.java - Add net/android/keystore_openssl.h, which provides a function that can wrap an existing PrivateKey JNI reference around an OpenSSL EVP_PKEY object which uses custom DSA/RSA/ECDSA methods to perform signing as expected to handle client certificates. net::android::GetOpenSSLPrivateKeyWrapper() - Add relevant unit tests for the new functions. Note that the unit test comes with its own Java helper function, which is used to create a platform PrivateKey object from encoded PKCS#8 private key data. This is called from the native unit test, but does not constitute a new Java test (AndroidKeyStoreTestUtil.java). - Add corresponding new test key files under net/data/ssl/certificates/, and their generation script in net/data/ssl/scripts/. - Add net/android/private_key_type_list.h which is used both from C++ and Java to define the list of supported private key types used by this code. - Minor improvements: Add a "release()" method to crypto::ScopedOpenSSL, add missing BASE_EXPORT to one base/android/jni_array.h function declaration.	net 11; android 11; chromium 7; java 7; add 7; which 6; daemon 5; linux 5; org 5; linux 5; chromium 5; strike 5; this 5; extension 4; for 4; 	166642		https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/11571059	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@181741 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

This is the initial implementation for screensaver extensions. The feature is currently behind a flag and installing an extension with a screensaver permission without the flag enabled will do nothing. This currently allows one Screensaver extension to be installed at a time, and brings up the screensaver after a fixed 2 minutes. Further work to be done is to add different timeouts for power manager if the screensaver is active, add more tests and add security features for the screensaver permission (if needed, this needs to be discussed still).

On Android the ashmem API is used to deal with shared memory. This API doesn't provide any way to open a memory region created by another process for security reasons. The only way to share memory on Android is to share the underlying file descriptor between processes. This can be accomplished by: - Creating a new shared memory region in a process. Note that this region can be anonymous (i.e. the string provided to ashmem_create_region() can be empty). - Forking and keeping open both in the parent and child processes the file descriptor corresponding to the previously created memory region. - Doing an mmap() in both processes (nothing special here). The unit test was deadlocking (stuck in the while loop in the child process) since the call to CreateNamed() wasn't opening the existing shared memory region (created by the parent process) but was actually creating a new shared memory region. This means that the two processes were actually seeing different memory regions. Since this also works on POSIX platforms, the unit test was modified to follow this strategy on all POSIX systems (including Android). On Windows the old strategy (using non-anonymous shared memory) is still used.	net 11; android 11; memory 9; chromium 7; java 7; add 7; fullscreen 7; screensaver 7; which 6; this 6; region 6; on 6; daemon 5; linux 5; org 5; 	136720		https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/11299159	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@169662 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

In addition to a Sandbox::Trap() handler, we now have a Sandbox::UnsafeTrap() handler. This feature should only be used for debugging purposes as it subverts the security of the sandbox. But it is useful to track down problems with the sandboxing policy. Within an unsafe trap handler, all sandbox restrictions are lifted. This, for example, allows us to allow system calls that would normally be denied by the policy, but to log their arguments, return value, and call stack.

This is awesome for many reasons: - Better performance! MSVC compiled code is as fast as some of the hand rolled assembly in certain cases (per rbultje). - Debugging symbols! (!!!) Crash dumps will now be symbolized with all symbols instead of the missing symbols traces we get in crash reports today. - No more hand rolling binaries every time ffmpeg needs a security fix or someone wants to make a change! - Greatly reduced binary size, the Chrome DLLs are ~3.2mb smaller and the Chromium DLLs ~2.3mb smaller: Chrome: 5205049 -> 1817600, Chromium: 3587185 -> 1147904. This change also cleans up the media library initialization code and gets rid of the old dll names in various places.  There is still one other locations which need to be updated separately: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/tools/build/site_config/config.py The downside is this will add ~3minutes of compile time (on T3500) for non-GOMA users and ~30 seconds for GOMA users (-j 256).

Due to UID isolation for security reasons, the render process can no longer have permissions to access internet. Since Android mediaplayer requires internet permission to work, it has to be moved to the browser process to resolve this. Here are the changes included in this patch: 1. Make WebMediaPlayerAndroid a common base class for WebMediaPlayerImplAndroid and WebMediaPlayerInProcessAndroid. WebMediaPlayerImplAndroid places the android mediaplayer in the brower process, this will be used for future chrome on android releases. WebMediaPlayerInProcessAndroid still places the android mediaplayer in the render process, this is being used for Layout tests.

(This is a reland of r132012, which was reverted in r132016 because it broke net_unittests on ChromeOS.) This change moves information about HSTS preloaded and public key pinning, that were previously written in code, into external files that can be consumed by other programs.

This is to avoid bugs like http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=118064 in the future. Positional parameters are supported by the VC++ runtime via the set of "_p" flavored printf-like routines. MSDN claims that "By default the positional functions behave identically to the non position ones, if no positional formatting is present." There is a little difference that require some attention though. Currently base::vsnprintf and base::vswprintf wrappers use "_s" functions (so called "security enhanced versions"). Judging by looking at the CRT code, _p functions implement the same checks as _s ones do. The base wrappers call the CRT routines so that count == (sizeOfBuffer - 1). This reduces most of the additional code in _vsnprintf_s (comparing to _vsprintf_p) to no-op. Namely: 1. When truncation happens the tail of the buffer is filled with a pattern: _SECURECRT__FILL_STRING(string, sizeInBytes, count + 1); This does not happen in our case because sizeInBytes == count + 1. 2. The special case check shown below was never true since sizeInBytes != count in our case: if (count == 0 && string == NULL && sizeInBytes == 0) 3. The following checks in _vsnprintf_s are also implemented in _vsnprintf_helper: _VALIDATE_RETURN(format != NULL, EINVAL, -1); _VALIDATE_RETURN(string != NULL && sizeInBytes > 0, EINVAL, -1); The only remaining difference between _vsnprintf_s and _vsprintf_p is that the former NULL-terminates the buffer and fills the rest a pattern if _vsnprintf_helper failed because of any reason other than truncation: string[0] = 0; _SECURECRT__FILL_STRING(string, sizeInBytes, 1); This CL write NULL to the end of the buffer in any error case (truncation or other reason).	windows 28; windows 28; test 27; ninja 27; test 27; ninja 27; for 24; for 24; net 11; android 11; net 11; memory 9; flag 9; flag 9; file 8; 			http://codereview.chromium.org/9702002	svn://svn.chromium.org/chrome/trunk/src@127788 0039d316-1c4b-4281-b951-d872f2087c98

In summary: - Moved state management to the Coyote Processor - Added a SocketWrapper to the APR socket - Added syncs to ensure only one async state change at a time - Added syncs to ensure only one thread changing a socket's state at a time A number of new bugs were also uncovered and fixed by this re-factoring: - delay processing complete() and dispatch() until request where startAsync() is called finished processing - onAsyncStart listener event Currently the test case for bug 49884 passes with the security manager enabled using "ab -n 5000 -c 150 -k ..." (it broke with "ab -n 50 -c 10 ..." previously) The unit tests pass for all three HTTP connectors. The AJP connectors have only been modified to ensure the code compiles. The following work remains: - Testing all connectors (HTTP and AJP) with TCK + security manager and fixing whatever is broken - Further clean-up - There is further scope for reducing code duplication between the connectors / aligning the code so it is easier to maintain.	windows 28; windows 28; test 27; ninja 27; test 27; ninja 27; for 24; for 24; html 16; html 16; fast 14; fast 14; net 11; android 11; net 11; 				https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/trunk@1001698 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
